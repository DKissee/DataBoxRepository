	Mr. Miracle woke up at 3:45am this morning.  He made himself a poppy seed bagel with butter for breakfast, 
and then took 2 showers.  Mister M. knew that this would be a special day, so he decided to wear his favorite green and yellow suit.  He combed his hair, and slid his shiny maroon shoes on.  He grabbed his gun,  just in case, and left 
through the front door.  As he went to step off the porch, he noticed the giant green bug.
